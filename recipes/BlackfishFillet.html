    <p style="text-align: center;">Blackfish is a kind of saltwater fish. Its fillet process is not very different from the common saltwater fish. Here is a general process:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> 1.Remove the gills, fins and other parts, and wash the fish.<br>2.Flattening: Lay the fish on the cutting board, and use a rolling pin or a knife to flatten it.<br>3.Skinning: Remove the skin of the fish with a knife, starting from the tail and moving towards the head.<br>4.Filleting: Use a sharp knife to slice the fish meat from the backbone to the head, starting from the tail and moving towards the head.
    <br>5.Trimming: Trim the edges of the fillet to remove any remaining bones or fins.<br>6.Packaging: Pack the fillets in a sealed container or wrap them in plastic wrap.<br>7.Refrigeration: Store the fillets in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.
    <br> that when processing blackfish, because its meat is more tender and thinner, it should be handled carefully to avoid excessive force and damage to the meat texture and affect the taste.</p>
